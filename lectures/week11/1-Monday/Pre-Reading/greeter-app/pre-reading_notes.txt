Render()
* render() method tells React what to draw to the page
* React will call render() automatically when its ready to display components
* There is a pair of () around the JSK with the opening ( on the same line as return
* Developers do this so they can format JSX with line breaks and indentation

A class component MUST have two things:
  1. extend.React.component
  2. have a render() method that returns JSX
  
Using a custom component involves two steps:
  1. importing the class component (in this example Greeter)
  2. Writing a JSX tag (Greeter JSX tag)  
  

** When importing a component, specify the relative path to the JavaScript file  

** A JSX tag is self-closing

PASSING PROPS 
  - To provide information to a component, you add props (which look identical to HTML attributes)
  - Inside a method use 'this' to refer to a specific instance of the component className
  - Props are always available under 'this.props'
  - You can treat props like variables - you can call the whatever you like
  - {} in JSX is like ${} in a Template literal
  - You CANNOT put if-else or loops inside {} in JSX
  - Props are not required

COMMENTS
* To add a comment to JSX: {/* */}

Array.map()

The .map() method does the following:
1. Expects to receive a function argument
2. Iterates over the elements of the Array
3. Passes each element to the function argument
4. Stores the returned value in a new Array
5. Returns the new Array
