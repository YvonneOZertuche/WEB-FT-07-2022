/**
 * 
 * You have a line of quarters. Write a function that returns the minimum number of changes necessary to make each quarter in the line of quarters alternate between heads and tails. 
 * 
 * For instance if the line of quarters were represented by the array 
 * [1,1,0,1,1], 
 * 
 * your function should return 2 because you need only 2 changes: changing the first 1 and the last 1 to zero.
